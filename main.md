# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

This is supposed to be a battery-included template to create publication ready documents from markdown.
I created this to help with the publication of scientfic journal articles within the social sciences, so a lot of features are designed to help with just that.

# Features {#sec:features}

## Acronyms {#sec:acronyms}
And i use the acronym [!aba] here for the first time, and here: [!aba] for the second time.

## Citations {#sec:citations}

Citations are stored in `rsc/library/references.json`.
They can be used as in-text with: @boswell:MigrationEuropepaper.2005 or in parentheses with [@boswell:MigrationEuropepaper.2005].

The style for the references is a CSL Stylesheet in `rsc/library/style.csl`. It defaults to APA7.

Both paths can be changed in the header of `main.md`.


## Images {#sec:images}

This is how to add images:

![This is not a cat !](rsc/images/Figure_1.eps){#fig:timeline .center width="100%"}

This is how to reference images:

As you can see in Figure @fig:timeline, this is cute.
Figures in the Appendix are numbered differently as you can see with @fig:catpic_A from Appendix @ap:super_important or Figure @fig:catpic_B from Appendix @ap:subsub


## Tables {#sec:tables}

This is how to include tables from csv files via `pantable` :

```{.table #tbl:test}
---
alignment: LLL
caption: Example Table from csv
width: [0.2,0.2,0.2]
include: rsc/tables/sample.csv
markdown: true
---
```

You can also create tables within the document.

``` {.table #tbl:possible_commands}
---
alignment: LLL
caption: Possible commands for pantable
header: true
markdown: true
table-width: 1.0
width: [0.2,0.2,0.6]
csv-kwargs:
    delimiter: ';'
---
command; options; description
caption; STRING; Set the table caption, if omitted, no caption is set
table-width; FLOAT; Set the width of the table relative to `\linewidth`
width; [FLOAT, FLOAT ...]; Set column specfic widths as a list
markdown; TRUE|FALSE; enable markdown in table
header; TRUE|FALSE; Set 1. row as a header
```

You can reference Table @tbl:possible_commands like this.
Table @tbl:desc are named differently.

## ToDo Notes {#sec:todos}

Classical Latex ToDo-Notes are also possible.
Note, however, that those will not show up in the docx Version of the Document.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 1 Mio BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
\todo[author=MM]{This needs to be changed}
\todo[author=KU]{I'm on it}

## Links to Sections {#sec:links-to-sections}

Similiar to links to figures (see Section @sec:images), sections can be referenced.
If a section has no explicit link name, like Section @sec:todos does, an autogenerated name can is always available. It is usually lowercased and spaced are replaced by a dash: `-`.


## Footnotes {#sec:footnotes}
This is how footnoes work[^1]. They are defined at the bottom[^10], and can have names[^myfootnote].
\todo{Maybe one day, I will be able to implement endnotes as well}

# Markdown Syntax {#sec:markdown-syntax}

You can write any valid **Markdown**. If this is not enough, \LaTeX commands are also _available_. Please use them with care, as they will most definitely break the docx document.


# The Appendix {#sec:the-appendix}

The appendix is numbered with literals. The first appendix is referenced as Appendix @ap:super_important.
Subsequent sections shoud be named B.1, B.1.1 etc.
References @ap:subappendix and @ap:subsub are nested examples

Tables in the appendix should be numbered as A1, A2 etc.
Here we reference the first table in Appendix @ap:super_important as Table @tbl:desc and another table in Section @ap:subsub as Table @tbl:subap.

# Discussion {#sec:discussion}

This part is reserved for the discussion.

[^1]: This is my important footnote.
[^10]: This is a second footnote.
[^myfootnote]: This does work too.
